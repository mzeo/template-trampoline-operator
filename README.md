# Template trampoline operator

As a part of my series on c++ abuse, the time
has come to examine the template trampoline operator.
I looks like a tiny person jumping of a trampoline.

```
___ >->o
```

It evaluates template until done. Code should be well
documented.

  WARNING: Creative grouping may have been used
  to make this work.

Original intention was to explore the trampoline monad
nature of the arrow operator. It may have gotten out of
control.
